Convert question to SQL. Return ONLY the SQL query.

TABLE: trade
COLUMNS: Year, Month, Direction, HS_Code, Description, Country, Value, Quantity, Unit, Revenue

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Country: ISO-2 codes (IN=India, CN=China, US=USA, AE=UAE, JP=Japan, DE=Germany)
2. Description: lowercase, use LIKE '%wheat%'
3. Direction: ONLY 'I' or 'E' (NEVER use 'Both')
4. Month: 1-12 (Baishakh=1, Jestha=2, Ashoj=6, Kartik=7, Chaitra=12)
5. Use Value for trade amounts (NOT Revenue unless question asks for duty/revenue)
6. Revenue ONLY for import duty questions
7. NO aliases, NO comments, keep simple
8. ALWAYS return valid SQL (never just semicolon or placeholders like <YEAR>)
9. When using ORDER BY with GROUP BY, MUST include column in SELECT
10. Use AND not commas in WHERE clause
11. For both imports and exports: WHERE Direction IN ('I', 'E')
12. Use random() NOT RAND() - CRITICAL
13. NEVER use aggregates in WHERE clause - use HAVING instead
14. For year placeholders, use actual years (2077-2082)
15. When selecting Country with GROUP BY, MUST include GROUP BY Country
16. NO OFFSET, NO FETCH - use LIMIT only
17. NO FLOOR, NO CEILING, NO ROUND in WHERE/HAVING
18. NO OVER(), NO window functions - keep SQL simple
19. For random sampling: ORDER BY random() LIMIT N
20. For median/percentile: use AVG as approximation
